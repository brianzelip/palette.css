# Palette.css

Don't write CSS, paint with it!

*work in progress*

*"single-declaration classes"*

functionalities to create:
- checkboxes - check one or more checkboxes to download files associated with each selected checkboxes
- input text field - take user input text as renaming of classnames for all the classes created for a given property
  - each property contains the set of classes, where the classes are named after each of the keyword values that the property has.

- i'm wanting to create a series of 'knobs to twiddle' pages that provide user inputs (text fields, buttons, ranges, checkboxes, radio btns, incremental (ie + and - btns), dials) in order to visualize how css properties work - properties like `transform` and more. This work would inform palette.css.

- another thought to provide sort of an api to all the different instances of categories in the various libraries out there, like resets (Tachyons, Basscss@v7, acss/atomizer, cole peters, the other dude in the uk - PUMA?, and one or two more - they all might have one), headings, grids -- provide a way to download as much or as little of all the different libraries, as well as other related libraries like Nicolas G.'s reset, and Eric M.'s reset, etc.
