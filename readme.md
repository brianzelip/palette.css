# Palette.css

Don't write CSS, paint with it!

*work in progress*

*"single-declaration classes"*

functionalities to create:
- checkboxes - check one or more checkboxes to download files associated with each selected checkboxes
- input text field - take user input text as renaming of classnames for all the classes created for a given property
  - each property contains the set of classes, where the classes are named after each of the keyword values that the property has.

- i'm wanting to create a series of 'knobs to twiddle' pages that provide user inputs (text fields, buttons, ranges, checkboxes, radio btns, incremental (ie + and - btns), dials) in order to visualize how css properties work - properties like `transform` and more. This work would inform palette.css.

- another thought to provide sort of an api to all the different instances of categories in the various libraries out there, like resets (Tachyons, Basscss@v7, acss/atomizer, cole peters, the other dude in the uk - PUMA?, and one or two more - they all might have one), headings, grids -- provide a way to download as much or as little of all the different libraries, as well as other related libraries like Nicolas G.'s reset, and Eric M.'s reset, etc.

- there's also this notion of what "paint with css" means. Meaning not only single-declaration classes, but interfacing well with all of the various modules out there, COMPOSABILITY, the idea for the palette.css auto form downloader customizer web interface user input app, is to provide quickly particular css modules that get bundled into a single, and ephemeral is ok, resource.

  In other words - palette.css is not just customizing your own classNames for The One True List of Single Declaration Classes, it's also quickly ingesting any other resource you might want to pull into the mix just for the halibut!
