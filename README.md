# üé® Palette.css

> **Don't write CSS\*, paint with it!** &trade;

This is a work-in-progress atomic css library that started from a modified fork of [Basscss v7.1.1](https://github.com/basscss/basscss/tree/a07f9e5eceed0df3fc638ef99559f7decf63aad1).

‚ö†Ô∏è Lookout, breaking changes lie ahead!

## Usage

Requires [postcss-custom-media](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-media) for use of [custom media queries](./src/vars/_breakpoints.css).

I ‚ù§Ô∏è Parcel!
